# GitHub Actions to Chocolatey Package Automation

**Complete Step-by-Step Implementation Guide**

This package provides everything you need to set up an automated system that uses GitHub Issues to trigger Chocolatey package creation through GitHub Actions and self-hosted runners.

## 📦 What's Included

This automation package contains **7 complete phases** with all necessary files, scripts, and documentation to implement a production-ready Chocolatey package automation system.

### Phase Structure
- **Phase 1**: Environment Preparation (PowerShell, Chocolatey, Git setup)
- **Phase 2**: Repository Configuration (Issue templates, workflows)
- **Phase 3**: Self-Hosted Runner Setup (Download, configure, install as service)
- **Phase 4**: Supporting Scripts (Package creation, testing, deployment)
- **Phase 5**: Configuration & Secrets (API keys, permissions)
- **Phase 6**: Testing the Complete Workflow (End-to-end validation)
- **Phase 7**: Troubleshooting (Common issues and solutions)

### Complete Repository Structure
Ready-to-deploy repository files with:
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Issue templates
- PowerShell automation scripts
- Documentation and README files

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Extract the package** to your desired location
2. **Follow each phase** in numerical order
3. **Run the provided scripts** for automated setup
4. **Test with a sample package** request

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2019+
- Administrator privileges
- GitHub repository (https://github.com/SharkByte561/CocoaPods)
- Internet connectivity
- PowerShell 5.1 or later

## 🔧 How It Works

### The Complete Workflow
1. **User creates GitHub Issue** using the provided template
2. **GitHub Actions detects** the issue with `package-request` label
3. **Self-hosted runner** executes PowerShell scripts
4. **Package is created** with proper Chocolatey structure
5. **Automated testing** validates installation/uninstallation
6. **Artifacts are uploaded** for download
7. **Issue is updated** with status and package information
8. **Optional deployment** to Chocolatey.org

### Key Features
- ✅ **Fully Automated**: Issue → Package creation → Testing → Deployment
- ✅ **Multiple Installer Types**: EXE, MSI, ZIP support
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and validation
- ✅ **Security**: Checksum validation, URL verification
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting
- ✅ **Self-Hosted**: Complete control over execution environment

## ⚡ Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Environment Preparation (15 minutes)
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
cd "Phase1-Environment-Preparation"
.\01-setup-powershell.ps1
.\02-install-chocolatey.ps1
.\03-install-git.ps1
.\04-setup-repository.ps1
```

### Phase 2: Repository Configuration (5 minutes)
